# Minting AGOBTC & AGOUSD

The process of creating new algorithmic tokens is based on the current _Target Collateral Ratio_, which uses in the token minting formula. This formula shows the required amount of both Collateral and Share tokens needed for the minting in defferent examples.

{% hint style="info" %}
The token minting formula is the same for both algo - tokens. The main difference will be applied only for the mechanism of the price stability, as our main goal to reach $1 peg in the case of AGOUSD and to repeat all the price movements of Bitcoin, using our native AGOBTC.
