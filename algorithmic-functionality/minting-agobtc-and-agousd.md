# Minting AGOBTC & AGOUSD

The process of creating new algorithmic tokens will be based on the minting formula, with the required amount of both Collateral and Share tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
The token minting formula is the same for both algo - tokens. The main difference will be applied only for the mechanism of the price stability, as our main goal to reach $1 peg in the case of AGOUSD and to repeat all the price movements of Bitcoin, using our native AGOBTC.
