# Argano governance

At this time, we can present a voting power system for the AGO token holders on the [SnapShot platform](https://snapshot.page/#/).

Community members will be eligible to vote for the introduction of the new features, adding new liquidity pools and token pairs, migrating to version 2.0, releasing new synthetic tokens, adjusting calculations, etc., by staking using their AGO tokens.
