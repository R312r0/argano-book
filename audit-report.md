# Audit report

### Overview

We have researched the current market of blockchain security solutions and came to the conclusion that the auditing standards of the [Obelisk](https://obeliskauditing.com/) team are the most suitable for us and our community. Our team has contacted Obelisk on the _**25th of June**_ in order to start the auditing process.

During the Obelisk review, Solidity specialists were very attentive to each possible issue and proposed different ways of solutions. Obelisk representatives were communicative and went to a meeting to solve existing problems. As the result, they have covered all possible vulnerabilities which were successfully fixed from our side.  
  
The source code analysis and on-chain verification of the core smart contracts were conducted. A valid audit review can be reached by the **link**
