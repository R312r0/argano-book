# Audit

### Overview

We have researched the current market of blockchain security solutions and came to the conclusion that the auditing standards of the [Obelisk](https://obeliskauditing.com/) team are the most suitable for us and our community. Argano team has contacted Obelisk on the _**25th of June**_ in order to start the auditing process. The audit was conducted between the 1st of July 2021 and the 31st of August 2021 and delivered on the 4th of September 2021.

The auditing process was divided into the next parts: manual analysis, static analysis, and on-chain analysis.  
  
During the Obelisk review, Solidity specialists were very attentive to each possible issue and proposed different ways of solutions**.** Obelisk representatives were communicative and went to a meeting to solve existing problems. As the result, they have covered all possible vulnerabilities which were successfully fixed from our side.
